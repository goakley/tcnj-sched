# Compiling

`make` to build the executable `sched` in the CWD, `make install` to install the executable and man page.

We're rolling our own sqlite3 amalgamation because this project in no way deserves the Autotools.

# Running

See the man page `man ./sched.1` (`man 1 sched` if installed).

Database contains sample rooms and sample user '623767' and may or may not contain sample reservations.

# Testing

No testing.  Manual test cases can be found in the 'cases' folder.
